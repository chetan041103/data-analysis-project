Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

A complete end-to-end Data Analytics project using Python (Data Cleaning), PostgreSQL (Querying), and Power BI (Visualization).

 Project Overview:

This project focuses on understanding customer purchase patterns using a real dataset.
The workflow includes:

Cleaning and preprocessing raw data using Python

Writing analytical queries in PostgreSQL

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights
The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions based on customer behavior.

 Tools & Technologies:

Python → Data cleaning, missing value handling, feature extraction

PostgreSQL → Data storage, querying, aggregations

Power BI → Dashboard creation & insights visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Code execution & exploratory analysis

GitHub → Version control & project hosting

                           

 Key Steps Performed:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)

Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Standardized column formats (dates, categories, numeric fields)

Performed feature engineering for behavioral insights

Exported cleaned data for SQL loading

2️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Created structured tables for customer transactions

Performed queries such as:

Most purchased products

Repeat customer frequency

Revenue segmentation

Monthly/weekly purchase trends

3️⃣ Dashboard (Power BI)

Built an interactive dashboard including:

Sales trend over time

Top-selling products

Customer segmentation by age, location & spending

Purchase frequency visualization

KPI summary cards (Total Revenue, Orders, Active Customers…)

📈 Insights Derived

Identified high-value and repeat customers

Discovered purchasing patterns across seasons and product categories

Analyzed behaviors that drive higher revenue

Helped design strategies for customer retention & targeted marketing
